### Coding Experience
I started coding in high school for my IB computer science course. We spent a long time on logic and pseudo code but eventually made projects using Java.

Currently, I've used C# and visual studio for over 10 weeks to create console applications.

Recently I have been learning how to create GUIs in visual studio.
